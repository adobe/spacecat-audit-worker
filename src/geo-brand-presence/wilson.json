      "answer": "Throwing a spiral depends on your grip, hand position, and the spin applied at release.

These fundamentals help optimize spin and accuracy, making it easier to throw a tight spiral [1].",

These build a powerful, accurate throw [1].",

Matches can be a single set to 21 points or best 2 out of 3, with the decisive third game played to 15. Teams must win by 2 points, with no point cap. Each side may contact the ball a maximum of three times before returning it, and blocking counts as one of those contacts. No player can hit the ball twice in succession except after a block, and the ball can touch any part of the body but must not be caught or thrown. Additional detailed rules include faults for illegal contact, ball handling, and interference at the net. For in-depth information, see Wilson's beach volleyball rules guide [1].",
